    "description": "I've modified the charts so that the respective stock's full history is visibile. Priorly, the charts cut off after 48 results. To achieve this, I've truncated the data fed to the graph, so that for charts with > 48 data points, they skip data points at even intervals to create a lower resolution (but accurate) full representation. If you think there's a better way, send me a message at <a href='mailto:support@coastlightdigital.com'>support@coastlightdigital.com</a>"
